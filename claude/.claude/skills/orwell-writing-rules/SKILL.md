# Orwell's Rules for Clear Writing

## Overview

Six rules from George Orwell's 1946 essay "Politics and the English Language." They fight vague, pretentious, stale writing.

## The Rules

### 1. Kill Dead Metaphors

Never use a metaphor, simile, or figure of speech you see often in print.

```
❌ "tip of the iceberg"
❌ "low-hanging fruit"
❌ "move the needle"
❌ "at the end of the day"
❌ "think outside the box"

✅ Say what you mean directly
✅ Create fresh comparisons if needed
```

### 2. Prefer Short Words

Never use a long word where a short one works.

| Long | Short |
|------|-------|
| utilize | use |
| implement | do, build |
| functionality | feature |
| methodology | method |
| leverage | use |
| facilitate | help |
| terminate | end |
| ascertain | learn, find |
| component | part |
| initiate | start |

### 3. Cut Ruthlessly

If you can cut a word, cut it.

```
❌ "in order to" → ✅ "to"
❌ "due to the fact that" → ✅ "because"
❌ "at this point in time" → ✅ "now"
❌ "in the event that" → ✅ "if"
❌ "a large number of" → ✅ "many"
❌ "is able to" → ✅ "can"
❌ "in spite of the fact" → ✅ "although"
❌ "for the purpose of" → ✅ "for" or "to"
```

### 4. Use Active Voice

Never use passive when active works.

```
❌ "The file was deleted by the user"
✅ "The user deleted the file"

❌ "The bug was introduced in v2.3"
✅ "We introduced the bug in v2.3" or "v2.3 introduced the bug"

❌ "It was decided that..."
✅ "We decided..." or "[Person] decided..."
```

### 5. Plain English Over Jargon

Never use foreign phrases, scientific words, or jargon when everyday English works.

```
❌ "per se" → ✅ "by itself" or "as such"
❌ "a priori" → ✅ "beforehand" or "in advance"
❌ "paradigm shift" → ✅ "big change"
❌ "synergy" → ✅ "working together"
❌ "bandwidth" (for time) → ✅ "time" or "capacity"
❌ "circle back" → ✅ "return to" or "discuss later"
```

**Exception:** Technical terms with no plain equivalent are fine. "API", "cache", "async" have specific meanings—don't dumb them down.

### 6. Break Rules to Avoid Barbarism

Break any rule rather than say something ugly or unclear.

If following rules makes your writing worse, don't follow them. Clarity beats dogma.

## Quick Check

Before finalizing text, ask:

1. Any stale phrases I've read a hundred times? → Replace or cut
2. Any long words with shorter equivalents? → Swap
3. Any words I can delete without losing meaning? → Delete
4. Any passive sentences that hide the actor? → Make active
5. Any jargon my reader won't know? → Translate
6. Does it sound natural when read aloud? → If not, rewrite

## Common Mistakes

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "Very unique" | Unique has no degrees | "Unique" |
| "Basically" | Filler | Delete |
| "Actually" | Usually filler | Delete unless contrasting |
| "In terms of" | Vague connector | Be specific or delete |
| "Going forward" | Corporate speak | Delete or "from now on" |

## When NOT to Apply

- Direct quotes (keep original wording)
- Legal/regulatory text (precision required)
- Established API names or technical terms
- When audience expects formal register
